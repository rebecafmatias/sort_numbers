# Lottery Number Generator

This project is a Python script to generate lottery numbers with a bias towards specific numbers. The script ensures that certain numbers (10, 20, and 25) are chosen more frequently, with 10 and 20 having a higher weight than 25. Additionally, the script guarantees that the generated sets of numbers do not contain any duplicates.

## Features

- Generates 15 unique lottery numbers from a pool of 1 to 25.
- Numbers 10 and 20 have a higher chance of being selected.
- Number 25 has a higher chance of being selected compared to the rest of the numbers, but lower than 10 and 20.
- Ensures no duplicate numbers in the generated sets.
- Generates multiple sets of lottery numbers for convenience.
